Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The product I'm handing in is supposed to be some sort of profile page for myself.

While working on this page, I actually figured out I might use it later - on once I polished it -
for later job applications or such.

I added several sections, such as a landing page, an overview of the current projects, some
educational background and the legal stuff (living in europe) as well as ways to get in touch.

For the files and their content:
- First page the user will stumble upon is index.html. This is where a short description
as well as further links lie.
- Projects contains the main current projects in a caroussel.
- Education lists my latest universities and places I teach.
- Contact & Legal is a Dropdown that leads to 3 pages; about and dpa contain information necessary
in my country, while contact.html lists ways in which to reach out.
- Css and scss are located in css folder
- html besides index.html is located in the html folder
- Two of the images lie in the images folder; the other images are external links
